        <title>Why you should learn Flutter?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-flutter&quot;&gt;What is Flutter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flutter is an open-source Mobile Application Development SDK launched by Google back in May 2017. It is used to create apps for both Android and iOS Operating Systems. It is also the primary method of developing applications for Google Fuchsia. Flutter 1.0 was announced on December 4th, 2018 at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/events/flutter-live/&quot;&gt;Flutter Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-flutter&quot;&gt;Why Flutter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incredibly easy to setup and get started!&lt;/strong&gt; - Download the Flutter SDK from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. Extract it and add the flutter sdk path to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable. Download the Flutter plugin in your favourite editor / IDE and...</description>

        <title>Nanosheets decorated with DNA</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;nanosheets-decorated-with-dna&quot;&gt;NANOSHEETS DECORATED WITH DNA&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;One possible means of bridging the gap between India’s abundant, varied natural resources and her ever-increasing requirements like clean water, food and rapid, low cost diagnostic machinery is the use of nanotechnology. When we modify materials at their atomic and molecular level, some very unusual and useful properties are generated. Since the dimensions of atoms and molecule are in nanometers, this technology is called nanotechnology. Efforts to promote research in nanotechnology in India began early in the millennium. The efforts have paid off well, India published over 23000 papers in nanoscience in the past 5...</description>

The nerve cells in our skin allow us to experience the several experiences of touch such as a cold splash of water, the tug of a strong breeze or the heat from your coffee mug. Scientists are trying to develop electronic skin to help robots and prosthetic devices to attain these abilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers report a new method in &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials &amp;amp; Interfaces&lt;/em&gt; that creates...</description>

        <title>NanoMachines</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article provides a brief insight in the field of nanomachines and nanosensors, the challenges faced by the researchers in this field, and the promise they hold for us in future applications&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-micro-and-nano-systems&quot;&gt;What is the difference between micro and nano systems?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we talk about about nanomachines, we consider devices which are only a few atoms apart in their dimensions whereas in microsystems, the dimensions are in the range of a few microns. Thus, these devices can only be observed under &lt;strong&gt;HR-TEM (High Resolution Tunneling Electron Microscope)&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;thermal imaging techniques.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/nanomachines/2-nanocars.png&quot; alt=&quot;A nano car developed by RICE...</description>

        <title>Gesture Controlled Robot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;JARVIS, Suit me Up!&quot;, &quot;Clang! Spoof! Phew!&quot;, Tony Stark becomes IRON MAN!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have You Ever Wondered, what if, just like that, with one cool move you too could control and move objects around you; OR Maybe develop a gesture-controlled game like in the movie Ra. One? Well, here I have tried to design and build a mini version of it; a Robot controlled by hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But first up, what exactly is a Gesture Controlled Robot?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Robot which detects any movement(gesture) and functions depending upon these signals is a Gesture Controlled Robot. They can use different technologies viz. accelerometer-based...</description>

        <title>Cloud Gaming</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Till today gaming had been possible only on dedicated machines like PCs, gaming consoles like nintendo, playstations and xbox and in the recent times on mobile phones too. But even today the AAA titles or the large budget games like Assassin’s Creed Unity, GTA 5 are only available on consoles and PCs(only windows), but a new technology is emerging today which aims to break all barriers and bring AAA gaming to all devices alike(yes, even to mac and linux). Read on to find what this new &lt;strong&gt;awesome tech&lt;/strong&gt; is all about and how you can get a glimpse of the...</description>

        <title>MicroLED</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-future-of-television&quot;&gt;The Future of Television?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently at the CES(Consumers Electronics Show) 2018 Samsung unveiled its prototype of the MicroLED at the consumer level with a 146inch MicroLED TV under the name “The Wall”. MicroLED technology was invented in the year 2000 by a research group run by Prof. Hongxing Jiang and Prof. Jingyu Lin of the Texas Tech University. However, the first demonstration of MicroLED as a consumer product can be traced back to Sony’s 55-inch FullHD “Crystal LED Display” that was showcased back in 2012. This was incredibly expensive and was not viable on a commercial scale....</description>

        <title>Ballistics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ballistics is the science of the propulsion, flight, and impact of projectiles especially bullets, unguided bombs or rockets. It is divided into several disciplines. &lt;em&gt;Internal and external ballistics&lt;/em&gt;, respectively, deal with the propulsion and the flight of projectiles. The transition between these two regimes is called &lt;em&gt;intermediate ballistics&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Terminal ballistics&lt;/em&gt; concerns the impact of projectiles which is a separate category that study the wounding of personnel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;internal-ballistics&quot;&gt;Internal Ballistics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A fire arm cartridge contains four components namely &lt;em&gt;Primer, Case, Propellent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bullet__.&lt;/em&gt; The basic working of a fire arm is that when the trigger is pressed the firing pin of...</description>

        <title>Zero Knowledge Proof</title>

This principle is based on an algorithm that takes some data as input and returns either &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-concept-behind-zkps&quot;&gt;Understanding the concept behind ZKPs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complexity of zero-knowledge proofs results in them typically being described with abstract examples, which elucidate the concept well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suppose there is an underground cave with...</description>

        <title>Organic Photovoltaics</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;organic-photovoltaics&quot;&gt;Organic Photovoltaics&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-&quot;&gt;Introduction :&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Photovoltaics is the process of directly converting sunlight into electricity without any heat engine to interfere. Photovoltaic devices are rugged and simple in design requiring very little maintenance and their biggest advantage being their construction as stand-alone systems to give outputs from microwatts to megawatts. Hence they are used for a vast array of applications resulting in the increase in demand for photovoltaics. Recently, ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS (OPV), has been the subject of active research as this technology has the potential to spawn a new generation of low-cost, solar-powered products with thin and flexible form...</description>
