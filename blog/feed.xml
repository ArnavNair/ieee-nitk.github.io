        <title>Photocatalytic Detoxification</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;photocatalytic-detoxification&quot;&gt;Photocatalytic Detoxification&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The water bodies around the world are regularly dumped with waste water effluents. These contain various organic and inorganic molecules that affect the aquatic life and overall water quality, which is called water pollution. The surprising fact is that quite a lot of purification is caused naturally by the breakdown of these molecules by sunlight. This process can be assisted with colloidal semiconductors to speed up the reaction process and increase the efficiency. The photocatalytic detoxification of wastewater is a process that combines heterogeneous catalysis with solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organic compounds such as alcohols,carboxylic acids,amines, herbicides and aldehydes,...</description>

        <title>Why you should learn Flutter?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-flutter&quot;&gt;What is Flutter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flutter is an open-source Mobile Application Development SDK launched by Google back in May 2017. It is used to create apps for both Android and iOS Operating Systems. It is also the primary method of developing applications for Google Fuchsia. Flutter 1.0 was announced on December 4th, 2018 at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/events/flutter-live/&quot;&gt;Flutter Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-flutter&quot;&gt;Why Flutter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incredibly easy to setup and get started!&lt;/strong&gt; - Download the Flutter SDK from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. Extract it and add the flutter sdk path to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable.

        <title>Nanosheets decorated with DNA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One possible means of bridging the gap between India’s abundant, varied natural resources and her ever-increasing requirements like clean water, food and rapid, low cost diagnostic machinery is the use of nanotechnology. When we modify materials at their atomic and molecular level, some very unusual and useful properties are generated. Since the dimensions of atoms and molecule are in nanometers, this technology is called nanotechnology. Efforts to promote research in nanotechnology in India began early in the millennium. The efforts have paid off well, India published over 23000 papers in nanoscience in the past 5 years. One of the recent...</description>

The nerve cells in our skin allow us to experience the several experiences of touch such as a cold splash of water, the tug of a strong breeze or the heat from your coffee mug. Scientists are trying to develop electronic skin to help robots and prosthetic devices to attain these abilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers report a new method in &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials &amp;amp; Interfaces&lt;/em&gt; that creates an ultrathin, stretchable...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article provides a brief insight in the field of nanomachines and nanosensors, the challenges faced by the researchers in this field, and the promise they hold for us in future applications&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-micro-and-nano-systems&quot;&gt;What is the difference between micro and nano systems?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we talk about about nanomachines, we consider devices which are only a few atoms apart in their dimensions whereas in microsystems, the dimensions are in the range of a few microns. Thus, these devices can only be observed under &lt;strong&gt;HR-TEM (High Resolution Tunneling Electron Microscope)&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;thermal imaging techniques.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/nanomachines/2-nanocars.png&quot; alt=&quot;A nano car developed by RICE...</description>
