        <title>Heard of Smart Contracts yet?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Smart contract, also known as a cryptocontract , is a computer program that directly controls the transfer of digital currencies or assets between parties under certain conditions.It not only defines the rules and penalties related to an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but it also automatically enforces those obligations. Smart contract are similar to a contract in the physical world, but it’s digital and is represented by a tiny computer program stored inside a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the main idea behind a Smart Contract?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since a smart contract removes reliance on a third party...</description>

        <title>Self Healing Materials</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough for bio-inspired technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many natural organisms have the ability to repair themselves. Now, manufactured machines will be able to mimic this property. Researchers have created a self-healing material that spontaneously repairs itself under extreme mechanical damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-biomimicry-&quot;&gt;What is biomimicry ?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Game-changing ideas begin by seeing the possibility for sustainable life reflected in the living system around us. Biomimicry is an approach to innovation that seeks sustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating nature’s time-tested patterns and strategies. The goal is to create products, processes, and policies which guide us to a new lifestyle that is sustainable and...</description>

        <title>The Missing Circuit Element</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-missing-circuit-element&quot;&gt;The Missing Circuit element&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leon Chau, an American circuit theorist at the University of California, predicted the existence of the fourth fundamental circuit passive element. The first three passive circuit elements are the resistor, capacitor, and inductor. We already have relationships among voltage, current, charge, and flux. The only relationship missing is that between flux and charge(q).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/the-missing-circuit-element/1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memristor is the component that connects the dots. The diagram shows how memristor serves as a missing link and completes the symmetry of the diagram due to which it is famously known as &lt;strong&gt;“The Missing Circuit element”&lt;/strong&gt;....</description>

        <title>Photocatalytic Detoxification</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;photocatalytic-detoxification&quot;&gt;Photocatalytic Detoxification&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The water bodies around the world are regularly dumped with waste water effluents. These contain various organic and inorganic molecules that affect the aquatic life and overall water quality, which is called water pollution. The surprising fact is that quite a lot of purification is caused naturally by the breakdown of these molecules by sunlight. This process can be assisted with colloidal semiconductors to speed up the reaction process and increase the efficiency. The photocatalytic detoxification of wastewater is a process that combines heterogeneous catalysis with solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organic compounds such as alcohols,carboxylic acids,amines, herbicides and aldehydes,...</description>

        <title>How Computers learn to play games!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how computers learn to play games like Chess or Go? Or how do they replace human players in Ludo or Card games? How Google’s Alpha-Go defeated the &lt;strong&gt;World Champion&lt;/strong&gt; of Go? Let us dive in the field of Computer Games and find out how Computers learn to play Games!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/How Computers LearnToPlayGames/chess.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chess&quot; title=&quot;Chess&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are various algorithms that are used to make a computer learn to play games. I will be discussing some of them to give you some intuition on how these algorithms work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;naive-tree-search&quot;&gt;Naive Tree Search&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-flutter&quot;&gt;What is Flutter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flutter is an open-source Mobile Application Development SDK launched by Google back in May 2017. It is used to create apps for both Android and iOS Operating Systems. It is also the primary method of developing applications for Google Fuchsia. Flutter 1.0 was announced on December 4th, 2018 at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/events/flutter-live/&quot;&gt;Flutter Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-flutter&quot;&gt;Why Flutter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incredibly easy to setup and get started!&lt;/strong&gt; - Download the Flutter SDK from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. Extract it and add the flutter sdk path to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable.
